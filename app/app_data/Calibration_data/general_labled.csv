"Edgar Snow's Account of ""The Long March""
A Nation Emigrates
Having successfully broken through the first line of fortifications, the Red Army set out on its epochal year-long trek to the west and to the north, a varicolored and many-storied expedition describable here only in briefest outline. The Communists told me that they were writing a collective account of the Long March, with contributions from dozens who made it, which already totaled about 300,000 words. Adventure, exploration, discovery, human courage and cowardice, ecstasy and triumph, suffering, sacrifice, and loyalty, and then through it all, like a flame, an undimmed ardor and undying hope and amazing revolutionary optimism of those thousands of youths who would not admit defeat by man or nature or God or death — all this and more seemed embodied in the history of an odyssey unequaled in modem times.
The Reds themselves generally spoke of it as the ""25,000-li March,"" and with all its twists, turns and countermarches, from the farthest point in Fukien to the end of the road in far northwest Shensi, some sections of the marchers undoubtedly did that much or more. An accurate stage-by-stage itinerary prepared by the First Army Corps [1] showed that its route covered a total of 18,088 li, or 6,000 miles — about twice the width of the American continent — and this figure was perhaps the average march of the main forces. The journey took them across some of the world's most difficult trails, unfit for wheeled traffic, and across the high snow mountains and the great rivers of Asia. It was one long battle from beginning to end.

Four main lines of defense works, supported by strings of concrete machine-gun nests and blockhouses, surrounded the Soviet districts in Southwest China, and the Reds had to shatter those before they could reach the unblockaded areas to the west. The first line, in Kiangsi, was broken on October 21, 1934; the second, in Hunan, was occupied on November 3; and a week later the third, also in Hunan, fell to the Reds after bloody fighting. The Kwangsi and Hunan troops gave up the fourth and last line on November 29, and the Reds swung northward into Hunan, to begin trekking in a straight line for Szechuan, where they planned to enter the Soviet districts and combine with the Fourth Front Army there, under Hsu Hsiang-ch'ien. Between the dates mentioned above, nine battles were fought. In all, a combination of 110 regiments had been mobilized in their path by Nanking and by the provincial warlords Ch'en Ch'i-tang, Ho Chien, and Pai Chung-hsi.

During the march through Kiangsi, Kwangtung, Kwangsi, and Hunan, the Reds suffered very heavy losses. Their numbers were reduced by about one-third by the time they reached the border of Kweichow province. This was due, first, to the impediment of a vast amount of transport, 5,000 men being engaged in that task alone. The vanguard was very much retarded, and in many cases the enemy was given time to prepare elaborate obstructions in the line of march. Second, from Kiangsi an undeviating northwesterly route was maintained, which enabled Nanking to anticipate most of the Red Army's movements.

Serious losses as a result of these errors caused the Reds to adopt new tactics in Kweichow. Instead of an arrowlike advance, they began a series of distracting maneuvers, so that it became more and more difficult for Nanking planes to identify the day-by-day objective of the main forces. Two columns, and sometimes as many as four columns, engaged in a baffling series of maneuvers on the flanks of the central column, and the vanguard developed a pincerlike front. Only the barest and lightest essentials of equipment were retained, and night marches for the greatly reduced transport corps — a daily target for the air bombing — became routine.

Anticipating an attempt to cross the Yangtze River into Szechuan, Chiang-Kai-shek withdrew thousands of troops from Hupeh, Anhui, and Kiangsi and shipped them hurriedly westward, to cut off ( from the north) the Red Army's route of advance. All crossings were heavily fortified; all ferries were drawn to the north bank of the river; all roads were blocked; great areas were denuded of grain. Other thousands of Nanking troops poured into Kweichow to reinforce the opium-soaked provincials of warlord Wang Chia-lieh, whose army in the end was practically immobilized by the Reds. Still others were dispatched to the Yunnan border, to set up obstacles there. In Kweichow, therefore, the Reds found a reception committee of a couple of hundred thousand troops, and obstructions thrown up everywhere in their path. This necessitated two great countermarches across the province, and a wide circular movement around the capital.

Maneuvers in Kweichow occupied the Reds for four months, during which they destroyed five enemy divisions, captured the headquarters of Governor Wang and occupied his foreign-style palace in Tsunyi, recruited about 20,000 men, and visited most of the villages and towns of the province, calling mass meetings and organizing Communist cadres among the youth. Their losses were negligible, but they still faced the problem of crossing the Yangtze. By his swift concentration on the Kweichow-Szechuan border, Chiang Kai-shek had skillfully blocked the short, direct roads that led to the great river. He now placed his main hope of exterminating the Reds on the prevention of this crossing at any point, hoping to push them far to the southwest, or into the wastelands of Tibet. To his various commanders and the provincial warlords he telegraphed: ""The fate of the nation and the party depends on bottling up the Reds south of the Yangtze.""

Suddenly, early in May, 1935, the Reds turned southward and entered Yunnan, where China's frontier meets Burma and Indochina. A spectacular march in four days brought them within ten miles of the capital, Yunnanfu, and warlord Lung Yun (Dragon Cloud) frantically mobilized all available troops for defense. Chiang's reinforcements meanwhile moved in from Kweichow in hot pursuit. Chiang himself and Mme. Chiang, who had been staying in Yunnanfu, hastily repaired down the French railway toward Indochina. A big squadron of Nanking bombers kept up their daily egg-laying over the Reds, but on they came. Presently the panic ended. It was discovered that their drive on Yunnanfu had been only a diversion carried out by a few troops. The main Red forces were moving westward, obviously with the intention of crossing the river at Lengkai, one of the few navigable points of the Upper Yangtze.

Through the wild mountainous country of Yunnan, the Yangtze River flows deeply and swiftly between immense gorges, great peaks in places rising in defiles of a mile or more, with steep walls of rock lifting almost perpendicularly on either side. The few crossings had all been occupied long ago by government troops. Chiang was well pleased. He now ordered all boats drawn to the north bank of the river and burned. Then he started his own troops, and Lung Yun's, in an enveloping movement around the Red Army, hoping to finish it off forever on the banks of this historic and treacherous stream.

Seemingly unaware of their fate, the Reds continued to march rapidly westward in three columns toward Lengkai. The boats had been burned there, and Nanking pilots reported that a Red vanguard had begun building a bamboo bridge. Chiang became more confident; this bridge-building would take weeks. But one evening, quite unobtrusively, a Red battalion suddenly reversed its direction. On a phenomenal forced march it covered eighty-five miles in one night and day, and in late afternoon descended upon the only other possible ferry crossing in the vicinity, at Chou P'ing Fort. Dressed in captured Nanking uniforms, the battalion entered the town at dusk without arousing comment, and quietly disarmed the garrison.

Boats had been withdrawn to the north bank — but they had not been destroyed. (Why spoil boats, when the Reds were hundreds of li distant, and not coming there anyway? So the government troops may have reasoned.) But how to get one over to the south bank? After dark the Reds escorted a village official to the river and forced him to call out to the guards on the opposite side that some government troops had arrived and wanted a boat. Unsuspectingly one was sent across. Into it piled a detachment of these ""Nanking"" soldiers, who soon disembarked on the north shore — in Szechuan at last. Calmly entering the garrison, they surprised guards who were peacefully playing mah-jong and whose stacked weapons the Reds took over without any struggle.

Meanwhile the main forces of the Red Army had executed a wide countermarch, and by noon of the next day the vanguard reached the fort. Crossing was now a simple matter. Six big boats worked constantly for nine days. The entire army was transported into Szechuan without a life lost. Having concluded the operation, the Reds promptly destroyed the vessels and lay down to sleep. When Chiang's forces reached the river, two days later, the rear guard of their enemy called cheerily to them from the north bank to come on over, the swimming was fine. The government troops were obliged to make a detour of over 200 li to the nearest crossing, and the Reds thus shook them from their trail. Infuriated, the Generalissimo now flew to Szechuan, where he mobilized new forces in the path of the oncoming horde, hoping to cut them off at one more strategic river — the great Tatu.

The Heroes of Tatu
The crossing of the Tatu River was the most critical single incident of the Long March. Had the Red Army failed there, quite possibly it would have been exterminated. The historic precedent for such a fate already existed. On the banks of the remote Tatu the heroes of the Three Kingdoms and many warriors since then had met defeat, and in these same gorges the last of the T'ai-p'ing rebels, an army of 100,000 led by Prince Shih Ta-k'ai, was in the nineteenth century surrounded and completely destroyed by the Manchu forces under the famous Tseng Kuo-fan. To warlords Liu Hsiang and Liu Wen-hui, his allies in Szechuan, and to his own generals in command of the government pursuit, Generalissimo Chiang now wired an exhortation to repeat the history of the T'ai-p'ing.

But the Reds also knew about Shih Ta-k'ai, and that the main cause of his defeat had been a costly delay. Arriving at the banks of the Tatu, Prince Shih had paused for three days to honor the birth of his son — an imperial prince. Those days of rest had given his enemy the chance to concentrate against him, and to make the swift marches in his rear that blocked his line of retreat. Realizing his mistake too late, Prince Shih had tried to break the enemy encirclement, but it was impossible to maneuver in the narrow terrain of the defiles, and he was erased from the map.

The Reds determined not to repeat his error. Moving rapidly northward from the Gold Sand River (as the Yangtze there is known) into Szechuan, they soon entered the tribal country of warlike aborigines, the ""White"" and ""Black"" Lolos of Independent Lololand. Never conquered, never absorbed by the Chinese who dwelt all around them, the turbulent Lolos had for centuries occupied that densely forested and mountainous spur of Szechuan whose borders are marked by the great southward arc described by the Yangtze just east of Tibet. Chiang Kai-shek could well have confidently counted on a long delay and weakening of the Reds here which would enable him to concentrate north of the Tatu. The Lolos' hatred of the Chinese was traditional, and rarely had any Chinese army crossed their borders without heavy losses or extermination.

But the Reds had already safely passed through the tribal districts of the Miao and the Shan peoples, aborigines of Kweichow and Yunnan, and had won their friendship and even enlisted some tribesmen in their army. Now they sent envoys ahead to parley with the Lolos. On the way they captured several towns on the borders of independent Lololand, where they found a number of Lolo chieftains who had been imprisoned as hostages by provincial Chinese warlords. Freed and sent back to their people, these men naturally praised the Reds.

In the vanguard of the Red Army was Commander Liu Po-ch'eng, [2] who had once been an officer in a warlord army of Szechuan. Liu knew the tribal people, and their inner feuds and discontent. Especially he knew their hatred of Chinese, and he could speak something of the Lolo tongue. Assigned the task of negotiating a friendly alliance, he entered their territory and went into conference with the chieftains. The Lolos, he said, opposed warlords Liu Hsiang and Liu Wen-hui and the Kuomintang; so did the Reds. The Lolos wanted to preserve their independence; Red policies favored autonomy for all the national minorities of China. The Lolos hated the Chinese because they had been oppressed by them; but there were ""White"" Chinese and ""Red"" Chinese, just as there were ""White"" Lolos and ""Black"" Lolos, and it was the White Chinese who had always slain and oppressed the Lolos. Should not the Red Chinese and the Black Lolos unite against their common enemies, the White Chinese? The Lolos listened interestedly. Slyly they asked for arms and bullets to guard their independence and help Red Chinese fight the Whites. To their astonishment, the Reds gave them both.

And so it happened that not only a speedy but a politically useful passage was accomplished. Hundreds of Lolos enlisted with the ""Red"" Chinese to march to the Tatu River to fight the common enemy. Some of those Lolos were to trek clear to the Northwest. Liu Po-ch'eng drank the blood of a newly killed chicken before the high chieftain of the Lolos, who drank also, and they swore blood brotherhood in the tribal manner. By this vow the Reds declared that whosoever should violate the terms of their alliance would be even as weak and cowardly as the fowl.
Thus a vanguard division of the First Army Corps, led by Lin Piao, reached the Tatu Ho. On the last day of the march they emerged from the forests of Lololand (in the thick foliage of which Nanking pilots had completely lost track of them), to descend suddenly on the river town of An Jen Ch'ang, just as unheralded as they had come into Chou P'ing Fort. Guided over narrow mountain trails by the Lolos, the vanguard crept quietly up to the little town and from the heights looked down to the river bank, and saw with amazement and delight one of the three ferryboats made fast on the south bank of the river! Once more an act of fate had befriended them.

How had it happened? On the opposite shore there was only one regiment of the troops of General Liu Wen-hui, the co-dictator of Szechuan province. Other Szechuan troops, as well as reinforcements from Nanking, were leisurely proceeding toward the Tatu, but the single regiment meanwhile must have seemed enough. A squad should have been ample, with all boats moored to the north. But the commander of that regiment was a native of the district; he knew the country the Reds must pass through, and how long it would take them to penetrate to the river. They would be many days yet, he could have told his men. And his wife, one learned, had been a native of An Jen Ch'ang, so he must cross to the south bank to visit his relatives and his friends and to feast with them. Thus it happened that the Reds, taking the town by surprise, captured the commander, his boat, and their passage to the north.

Sixteen men from each of five companies volunteered to cross in the first boat and bring back the others, while on the south bank the Reds set up machine guns on the mountainsides and over the river spread a screen of protective fire concentrated on the enemy's exposed positions. It was May. Floods poured down the mountains, and the river was swift and even wider than the Yangtze. Starting far upstream, the ferry took two hours to cross and land just opposite the town. From the south bank the villagers of An Jen Ch'ang watched breathlessly. They would be wiped out! But wait. They saw the voyagers land almost beneath the guns of the enemy. Now, surely, they would be finished. And yet . . . from the south bank the Red machine guns barked on. The onlookers saw the little party climb ashore, hurriedly take cover, then slowly work their way up a steep cliff overhanging the enemy's positions. There they set up their own light machine guns and sent a downpour of lead and hand grenades into the enemy redoubts along the river.

Suddenly the White troops ceased firing, broke from their redoubts, and fled to a second and then a third line of defense. A great murmur went up from the south bank and shouts of ""Hao!"" drifted across the river to the little band who had captured the ferry landing. Meanwhile the first boat returned, towing two others, and on the second trip each carried eighty men. The enemy had fled. That day and night, and the next, and the next, those three ferries of An Jen Ch'ang worked back and forth until at last nearly a division had been transferred to the northern bank, but the river flowed faster and faster. The crossing became more and more difficult. On the third day it took four hours to shift a boatload of men from shore to shore. At this rate it would be weeks before the whole army and its animals and supplies could be moved. Long before the operation was completed they would be encircled. The First Army Corps had now crowded into An Jen Ch'ang, and behind were the flanking columns, and the transport and rear guard. Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes had found the spot, and heavily bombed it. Enemy troops were racing up from the southeast; others approached from the north. A hurried military conference was summoned by Lin Piao. Chu Teh, Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, and P'eng Teh-huai had by now reached the river. They took a decision and began to carry it out at once.
Some 400 li to the west of An Jen Ch'ang, where the gorges rise very high and the river flows narrow, deep, and swift, there was an iron-chain suspension bridge called the Liu Ting Chiao — the Bridge Fixed by Liu. [3] It was the last possible crossing of the Tatu east of Tibet. Toward this the barefoot Reds now set out along a trail that wound through the gorges, at times climbing several thousand feet, again dropping low to the level of the swollen stream itself and wallowing through waist-deep mud. If they captured the Liu Ting Chiao the whole army could enter central Szechuan. If they failed they would have to retrace their steps through Lololand, re-enter Yunnan, and fight their way westward toward Likiang on the Tibetan border — a detour of more than a thousand li, which few might hope to survive.

As their main forces pushed westward along the southern bank, the Red division already on the northern bank moved also. Sometimes the gorges between them closed so narrowly that the two lines of Reds could shout to each other across the stream; sometimes that gulf between them measured their fear that the Tatu might separate them forever, and they stepped more swiftly. As they wound in long dragon Ales along the cliffs at night their 10,000 torches sent arrows of light slanting down the dark face of the imprisoning river. Day and night these vanguards moved at double-quick, pausing only for brief ten-minute rests and meals, when the soldiers listened to lectures by their weary political workers, who over and over again explained the importance of this one action, exhorting each to give his last breath, his last urgent strength, for victory in the test ahead of them. There could be no slackening of pace, no halfheartedness, no fatigue. ""Victory was life,"" said P'eng Teh-huai; ""defeat was certain death.""

On the second day the vanguard on the right bank fell behind. Szechuan troops had set up positions in the road, and skirmishes took place. Those on the southern bank pressed on more grimly. Presently new troops appeared on the opposite bank, and through their field glasses the Reds saw that they were White reinforcements, hurrying to the Bridge Fixed by Liu. For a whole day these troops raced each other along the stream, but gradually the Red vanguard, the pick of all the Red Army, pulled away from the enemy's tired soldiers, whose rests were longer and more frequent, whose energy seemed more spent, and who were perhaps none too anxious to die for a bridge.

The Bridge Fixed by Liu was built centuries ago, and in the manner of all bridges of the deep rivers of western China. Sixteen heavy iron chains, with a span of some 100 yards or more, were stretched across the river, their ends imbedded on each side under great piles of cemented rock, beneath the stone bridgeheads. Thick boards lashed over the chains made the road of the bridge, but upon their arrival the Reds found that half this wooden flooring had been removed, and before them only the bare iron chains swung to a point midway in the stream. At the northern bridgehead an enemy machine-gun nest faced them, and behind it were positions held by a regiment of White troops. The bridge should, of course, have been destroyed, but the Szechuanese were sentimental about their few bridges; it was not easy to rebuild them, and they were costly. Of Liu Ting it was said that ""the wealth of the eighteen provinces contributed to build it."" And who would have thought the Reds would insanely try to cross on the chains alone? But that was what they did.

No time was to be lost. The bridge must be captured before enemy reinforcements arrived. Once more volunteers were called for. One by one Red soldiers stepped forward to risk their lives, and, of those who offered themselves, thirty were chosen. Hand grenades and Mausers were strapped to their backs, and soon they were swinging out above the boiling river, moving hand over hand, clinging to the iron chains. Red machine guns barked at enemy redoubts and spattered the bridgehead with bullets. The enemy replied with machine-gunning of his own, and snipers shot at the Reds tossing high above the water, working slowly toward them. The first warrior was hit, and dropped into the current below; a second fell, and then a third. But as others drew nearer the center, the bridge flooring somewhat protected these dare-to-dies, and most of the enemy bullets glanced off, or ended in the cliffs on the opposite bank.

Probably never before had the Szechuanese seen fighters like these — men for whom soldiering was not just a rice bowl, and youths ready to commit suicide to win. Were they human beings or madmen or gods? Was their own morale affected? Did they perhaps not shoot to kill? Did some of them secretly pray that these men would succeed in their attempt? At last one Red crawled up over the bridge flooring, uncapped a grenade, and tossed it with perfect aim into the enemy redoubt. Nationalist officers ordered the rest of the planking torn up. It was already too late. More Reds were crawling into sight. Paraffin was thrown on the planking, and it began to bum. By then about twenty Reds were moving forward on their hands and knees, tossing grenade after grenade into the enemy machine-gun nest.

Suddenly, on the southern shore, their comrades began to shout with joy. ""Long live the Red Army! Long live the Revolution! Long live the heroes of Tatu Ho!"" For the enemy was withdrawing in pell-mell flight. Running full speed over the remaining planks of the bridge, through the flames licking toward them, the assailants nimbly hopped into the enemy's redoubt and turned the abandoned machine gun against the shore.
More Reds now swarmed over the chains, and arrived to help put out the fire and replace the boards. And soon afterwards the Red division that had crossed at An Jen Ch'ang came into sight, opening a flank attack on the remaining enemy positions, so that in a little while the White troops were wholly in flight — either in flight, that is, or with the Reds, for about a hundred Szechuan soldiers here threw down their rifles and turned to join their pursuers. In an hour or two the whole army was joyously tramping and singing its way across the River Tatu into Szechuan. Far overhead angrily and impotently roared the planes of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Reds cried out in delirious challenge to them.

For their distinguished bravery the heroes of An fen Ch'ang and Liu Ting Chiao were awarded the Gold Star, highest decoration in the Red Army of China.

Olive oil historically has been used for an absurd number of things it’s really fascinating how many uses have been found for it: cooking (obviously) but also as a lubricant, a salve (ointment used to heal/protect), and lamp fuel to name a few. All that to say it is an incredibly versatile substance. As a lubricant it can allow two seemingly uncooperating systems to mesh as if they were one, as a fuel it can be a driver of change guiding others to new paths, and as a salve it can be used to heal wounds and protect against further damage.

Because both of my parents worked every day when I would come home from school I would be greeted by my grandmother. And I to her dismay instead of greeting her back I would say in Arabic “what’s there to eat” and she always reluctantly but out of love would tell me and it was almost always a dish cooked with olive oil a staple of my culture. 

I remember a time when I ran out of shaving gel and couldn't go to the store. Then I thought about the olive oil in the kitchen. Wondering if it would work, I applied it to my face – surprisingly, it did, giving me the smoothest shave ever. Similarly, I once had a sanding gadget with sticking gears. The solution? Olive oil. I rushed to the kitchen, grabbed some, and applied it to the gears, and it worked like a charm. The sander never gave me trouble again.

I’ve always found this quite inspiring, that is a seemingly mundane golden liquid’s ability to fit into so many aspects of life and facilitate corporation. To not force two things, whether foods or a mechanical system to work together but to persuade them gently. In my experience this persuasion is key for a functional team. Not only as a leader but as a follower.

In many ways I am and try to be like olive oil, not just in terms of origin with the first domestic olive tree sprouting in Syria around 8000 years ago the home of my family for centuries. But also, with how I work with others.

In my junior year me and 17 other students (but only 10 stayed the whole year) took part in the Mate ROV internship, where we multiple teams across the state competed in building an ROV (remote operated underwater vehicle). I personally was responsible for leading the design and building of the propulsion systems. But I think where my leadership was more exemplary was on competition day.

It was about an hour’s drive from all of us and the competition started It was early in the morning, around 7am we had to drag all the stuff inside. It was about 120lbs of stuff altogether and we had to take it down to flights of stairs to the blisteringly hot and humid Olympic sized swimming pool. When finally got everything in and ready to go murphy’s law kicked in and everything was starting to go wrong. But we got our heads in the game and got everything set up and ready to go. 

We were competing first so as we got called up our team leader selected me to lead the piloting crew. Side note here the way we compete is by getting a group of five, three on the control station and two managing the tether which is the link between us and the ROV, the two cannot talk to each other. I was on the control station side. Naturally tensions were through the roof, I mean this was the culmination of half a year work. Heading over we where all shaking.

Olive oil has been used as a fuel for melena lighting the path for others. Remembering this I reassured our team that we had planned this out meticulously. We knew what we were going to do, how long it was going to take and had back up plans for our back up plans. 

As we got into our stations everyone hyper focused, the judge started the timer and we began. My role there wasn’t technical although I had understanding of the systems at play some I designed myself, my role was to insure they worked together seamlessly. As olive oil has been used as a lubricant, I understood my part in now was the same. To ensure harmonious cooperation between all team mates. Thinking this as I relayed information between the judge, our pilot, and our tasks manager. 

As salve  olive oil had been used to heal and protect wounds. During the competition we faced more issues than I care to recount some our faut and others due to our situation these mistakes cost us the competition. Although we understood this as we heard the time ring, we dropped the controls. Disheartened as we walked back to our post I said to my team, there is always next year we take what we learned now and apply it and there is no way we don’t win. 


Here is what i have so far

"can you create a title for my rhtorical anylis essay here ""“Finally, I’ve come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us. The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned. We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation.” (Stevenson 18)

Since the beginning of an organized society oppression has been present, influencing actions taken against certain groups marginalizing them and artificially limiting them to the lower bounds of society. Author and lawyer, Bryan Stevenson, explores this concept in his memoir, Just Mercy A Story of Justice and Redemption. Wherein he writes to those who are unfamiliar with the current state of the American Criminal justice system, highlighting its flaws and how it treats those who are disfavored under prejudice penalizing them for crimes that would have received lighter sentencing otherwise. Using rhetoric and rhetorical moves Stevenson effectively persuades readers that our true measure of character as a society is how we treat those with less power and representation than we have our selfs, employing pathos, logos, and parallelism to solidify his argument and inspire his audience to take action for change and justice.

In writing Just Mercy Stevenson accounts his experiences as a criminal justice lawyer working in the deep South with inmates on death row. In exploring his story the rhetorical moves used and the manner in which they are presented becomes more apparent. The excerpt above mentioned comes from the end of the first chapter and is meant to highlight the focus of the book moving on very much so a jumping of point. As such there is specific context building up to it. With before Stevenson discussing his history and what lead him to become a criminal justice lawyer, how he was exposed to issues with race and inequality in court and legal systems. To talking about his experiences as a criminal justice lawyer from his position at this point in his life, it serves to act as a thesis of the book specifying the central argument that will be referred back to later on. (ADD TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH) 

(ADD TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH) Stevenson’s use of Pathos is effective as it allows the reader to relate on an emotional and personal level not only to the argument presented but with the implications of what is being writen. In writing “We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated” (Stevenson 18). Stevenson appeals to the emotions of his readers as it incorporates them into the situation where they are implicated in events taking place throughout the book, giving them a sense of responsibility in being part of the change taking place throughout the book. Not just as bystanders but as witnesses to the injustices that take place throughout Just Mercy and to a degree morally at least, liable. And in writing, “An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation” (Stevenson 18). Stevenson directly presents readers with a choice of compassion or corruption as those two are multeity exclusive with either one or the other forcing a choice on readers. This to is effective as readers have two options now, either to accept injustice as it is and be complicit in the rest of the actions taking place in the book or to renounce indifference to the events talking place and to hold some responsibility forcing a deeper and more personal connection with the arguments Stevenson presented in the book. Overall Stevenson’s use of pathos is effective as it places readers in a direct position of responsibility for the arguments presented in the expert and subsequently the rest of the book. (ADD TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH)

(ADD TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH) In writing Just Mercy Stevenson uses logos or logical appeal of arguments to readers quite effectively. Resonating with readers on the fundamental logical principle of our treatment of those we have power over or have little power to defend themselves is what reflects our true character as there is nothing at stake for us but everything at stake for them. Stevenson writes “Finally, I’ve come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us” (Stevenson 18). In writing this readers are presented with a logical argument one that they will have likely encountered before, stating fundamentally that those who have power and our treatment of them cannot be the measure by which we as a society quantify “our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality” (Stevenson 18) as there are limitations on how we can treat those above us as they simply have the power to retaliate. In stating this logically and so bluntly Stevenson highlights blatantly that it is of little matter how the rich are treated to the measure of our fairness in society because we are incentivized as a collective to treat them in a positive manner and to this Stevenson writes in the very next sentence “The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned” (Stevenson 18). In this logos is used again to complete the message of the sentence before it being that the measure of our character is that of how we treat those who we have little incentive to treat with respect and due prosses. In this argument Stevenson displays an effective use of logos as this is fundamental to human nature that selflessness and character cannot be measured when there is a something to gain like there tends to be when prosecuting the rich but rather when there is nothing at stake like is often the case when prosecuting the poor and disenfranchised. Overall, a mastery of this logos contributing to his final argument’s validity. (ADD TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH)

(ADD TRANSITION TO NEXT PARAGRAPH) Stevenson employs parallelism effectively as the method of delivery in presenting an argument both of logos and pathos and in the way of emphasizing each group and society treatment of them,. That is to say Stevenson by repeating descriptions of certain groups and phrases emphasizes the determined of systems of oppression on individuals who are discriminated against. In doing so Stevenson is able to create a rhythm and build up to the final point presented in the later parts of the excerpt, better persuading the audience. As this excerpt can be broken down into three distinct sections, the first in reference to treatment of those who are affluent and have power. The second in reference to the condemned and oppressed who have no power. And lastly the danger of the mistreatment of the condemned believing we as a society are just based on how we collectively treat the rich and not the poor. In doing this Stevenson is able to set up a structure of which is carried on throughout the excerpt. Where the sentence begins with “Finally, I’ve come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality” (Stevenson 18). Very clearly creating a rhythm and distinct structure to the sentence that will be used to complete the argument later on. And ending with “cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us” (Stevenson 18). Stevenson is able not only create a rhythm in writing like this but a recognizable pattern that will be use latter on in writing “The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned” (Stevenson 18). Completing the statement from before about treatment of the rich and powerful, and finally completing the argument as a whole in writing “We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation” (Stevenson 18). Where reasoning is given. With that somewhat tedious yet crucial break down of the excerpt done parallelism can be observed as a underlying theme throughout the excerpt being used identify and emphasize what Stevenson wants his readers to focus on, the relationship between our perception of our selves and our true character. In using parallelism in this manner Stevenson is able to highlight disparities in our treatment as a collective of those who are deemed to be lower class. | Stevenson creates a sense of rhythm and balance that draws attention to these key phrases and reinforces their importance. This repetition helps to solidify the argument that justice, fairness, and equality are the most important values by which a society should be judged, and that these values should be extended to everyone in society, not just those who are already privileged. | Rhetorically this is effective as attention is drawn to the underlying topic of Stevenson’s argument throughout Just Mercy serving to bring to the attention of readers this habit we have and in doing so exposing the deeper meaning of Stevenson’s message in just mercy. 

In conclusion Bryan Stevenson in writing Just mercy effectively uses rhetoric and rhetorical moves effectively in order to inspire his audience to take action for change and justice. In the form of pathos Stevenson relates to readers on an emotional level implicating them in the situation of the text and putting on them a sense of emotional responsibility allowing readers to better relate to the events taking place in the book. Through logos Stevenson resonates with readers on a logical level arguing fundamental treatment of those we have power over or have little power to defend themselves is what reflects our true character placing logical president for the argument presented at hand. And lastly through parallelism Stevenson delivers his argument to readers in a structured and order fashion allowing the text to be easily understood and rhythmic in nature easing understanding of the text allow for more readers to relate to it. Overall Stevenson’s use of rhetoric in the excerpt above is effective in conveying the disparities between """,0,0.65,
