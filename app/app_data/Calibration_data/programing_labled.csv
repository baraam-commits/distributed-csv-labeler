"In my team we use Docker containers to locally run our website applications while we do development on them. Assuming I'm working on a Flask app at app.py with dependencies in requirements.txt , a working flow would look roughly like this: Now we have a local server running our application, and we can make changes to the local files and the server will refresh as needed. In the above example, the application end up running as the root user. This isn't a problem unless the application writes files back into the working directory. If it does then we could end up with files (e.g. something like cache.sqlite or debug.log ) in our working directory owned by root . This has caused a number of problems for users in our team. For our other applications we've solved this by running the application with the host user's UID and GID - e.g. for a Django app: In this case, the application will be running as a non-existent user with ID 1000 inside the container, but any files written to the host directory end up correctly owned by the robin user. This works fine in Django. However, Flask refuses to run as a non-existent user (in debug mode): Does anyone know if there's any way that I could either: Make Flask not worry about the unassigned user-id, or Somehow dynamically assign the user ID to a username at runtime, or Otherwise allow the docker application to create files on the host as the host user? The only solution I can think of right now (super hacky) is to change the permissions of /etc/passwd in the docker image to be globally writeable, and then add a new line to that file at runtime to assign the new UID/GID pair to a username.",1,0.9

"As noted in this answer by Sam Roberts and this other answer by gnovice , MATLAB's colon operator ( start:step:stop ) creates a vector of values in a different way that linspace does. In particular, Sam Roberts states: However, offical documentation about this from The MathWorks has been deleted from their site. If Sam's description is correct, wouldn't the errors in the step sizes be symmetric? Interesting things to note about the colon operator: Its values depend on its length: It can generate repeated values if they are rounded: There is a tolerance for the last value, if the step size creates a value just above the end, this end value is still used:",0,0.92

For eg: **excel file1** **excel file2** **excel file3** Name City State Name City Zip Name City County In my existing SQL table I have columns- **Name City Population Schools** What is the best way to insert the new excel files with similar columns names into existing SQL db. Thought so far - Copy new excel file data into temporary tables and then insert into existing table. Problem is that how write c# code/sqlquery which would insert new excel data with more or less columns than existing SQL table Please suggest.,1,0.9

"There are two files, say FileA and FileB and we need to find all the numbers that are in FileA which is not there in FileB. All the numbers in the FileA are sorted and all the numbers in FileB are sorted. For example, Input: Output: The memory is very limited and even one entire file cannot be loaded into memory at a time. Also linear or lesser time complexity is needed. So if the files are small enough to fit in the memory, we could load them and initialize its contents as two sets and then take a set difference so that the problem is solved in O(1) or constant time complexity. But since the files are so big, they won't be able to load entirely into the memory and so this is not possible. Also, another approach would be to use a brute force method with batch processing. So, we load a chunk or batch of data from FileA and then a batch from FileB and then compare it and then the next chunk from FileB and so on. Then after the FileA chunk is checked over all the elements in FileB then load the next batch from FileA and this continues.

"I'm very familiar with the concepts of interfaces and abstract classes, but not super familiar with the concepts of mixins . Right now, in Dart, every class A defines an implicit interface, which can be implemented by another class B by using the implements keyword. There's no explicit way of declaring interfaces as, for example, in Java, where an interface contains only unimplemented methods (and eventually static variables). In Dart, since interfaces are defined by classes, the methods of the interface A may actually already be implemented, but the class that implements B still needs to override these implementations. We can see that situation from the following piece of code: In Dart, a mixin is also defined via ordinary class declarations... A mixin is basically a class that can define both unimplemented or implemented methods. It's a way to add methods to another class without needing to logically use inheritance. In Dart, a mixin is applied to a super class, that is extended via ""normal"" inheritance, like in the following example: In this case, we should note that B does not have to implement any further methods both of A and MyMixin . There's a clear distinction between applying a mixin to a class and inheriting from a class, at least in a language that supports only single-parent inheritance, since, in that case, we could apply many mixins to a class, but a class could just inherit from another class. There's also a clear distinction between implementing an interface and inheriting from a class. The class that implements an interface needs to mandatorily implement all methods defined by the interface. So, in summary, the concept of implementing an interface is more about establishing a contract with the class that implements the interface, and the concept of mixins (as the name suggests) is more about reusing code (without recurring to an inheritance hierarchy). When to use mixins and when to use interfaces in Dart? Are there some rules of thumb for at least special recurrent patterns when designing software where it would be better to define a mixin and applying it to a super class rather than making our class implement an interface? I would appreciate concrete examples of design decisions in a context where both interfaces and mixins could be used, but one is used over the other (for some reason).",1,0.9

"Edgar Snow's Account of ""The Long March""
A Nation Emigrates
Having successfully broken through the first line of fortifications, the Red Army set out on its epochal year-long trek to the west and to the north, a varicolored and many-storied expedition describable here only in briefest outline. The Communists told me that they were writing a collective account of the Long March, with contributions from dozens who made it, which already totaled about 300,000 words. Adventure, exploration, discovery, human courage and cowardice, ecstasy and triumph, suffering, sacrifice, and loyalty, and then through it all, like a flame, an undimmed ardor and undying hope and amazing revolutionary optimism of those thousands of youths who would not admit defeat by man or nature or God or death — all this and more seemed embodied in the history of an odyssey unequaled in modem times.
The Reds themselves generally spoke of it as the ""25,000-li March,"" and with all its twists, turns and countermarches, from the farthest point in Fukien to the end of the road in far northwest Shensi, some sections of the marchers undoubtedly did that much or more. An accurate stage-by-stage itinerary prepared by the First Army Corps [1] showed that its route covered a total of 18,088 li, or 6,000 miles — about twice the width of the American continent — and this figure was perhaps the average march of the main forces. The journey took them across some of the world's most difficult trails, unfit for wheeled traffic, and across the high snow mountains and the great rivers of Asia. It was one long battle from beginning to end.

Four main lines of defense works, supported by strings of concrete machine-gun nests and blockhouses, surrounded the Soviet districts in Southwest China, and the Reds had to shatter those before they could reach the unblockaded areas to the west. The first line, in Kiangsi, was broken on October 21, 1934; the second, in Hunan, was occupied on November 3; and a week later the third, also in Hunan, fell to the Reds after bloody fighting. The Kwangsi and Hunan troops gave up the fourth and last line on November 29, and the Reds swung northward into Hunan, to begin trekking in a straight line for Szechuan, where they planned to enter the Soviet districts and combine with the Fourth Front Army there, under Hsu Hsiang-ch'ien. Between the dates mentioned above, nine battles were fought. In all, a combination of 110 regiments had been mobilized in their path by Nanking and by the provincial warlords Ch'en Ch'i-tang, Ho Chien, and Pai Chung-hsi.

During the march through Kiangsi, Kwangtung, Kwangsi, and Hunan, the Reds suffered very heavy losses. Their numbers were reduced by about one-third by the time they reached the border of Kweichow province. This was due, first, to the impediment of a vast amount of transport, 5,000 men being engaged in that task alone. The vanguard was very much retarded, and in many cases the enemy was given time to prepare elaborate obstructions in the line of march. Second, from Kiangsi an undeviating northwesterly route was maintained, which enabled Nanking to anticipate most of the Red Army's movements.

Serious losses as a result of these errors caused the Reds to adopt new tactics in Kweichow. Instead of an arrowlike advance, they began a series of distracting maneuvers, so that it became more and more difficult for Nanking planes to identify the day-by-day objective of the main forces. Two columns, and sometimes as many as four columns, engaged in a baffling series of maneuvers on the flanks of the central column, and the vanguard developed a pincerlike front. Only the barest and lightest essentials of equipment were retained, and night marches for the greatly reduced transport corps — a daily target for the air bombing — became routine.

Anticipating an attempt to cross the Yangtze River into Szechuan, Chiang-Kai-shek withdrew thousands of troops from Hupeh, Anhui, and Kiangsi and shipped them hurriedly westward, to cut off ( from the north) the Red Army's route of advance. All crossings were heavily fortified; all ferries were drawn to the north bank of the river; all roads were blocked; great areas were denuded of grain. Other thousands of Nanking troops poured into Kweichow to reinforce the opium-soaked provincials of warlord Wang Chia-lieh, whose army in the end was practically immobilized by the Reds. Still others were dispatched to the Yunnan border, to set up obstacles there. In Kweichow, therefore, the Reds found a reception committee of a couple of hundred thousand troops, and obstructions thrown up everywhere in their path. This necessitated two great countermarches across the province, and a wide circular movement around the capital.

Maneuvers in Kweichow occupied the Reds for four months, during which they destroyed five enemy divisions, captured the headquarters of Governor Wang and occupied his foreign-style palace in Tsunyi, recruited about 20,000 men, and visited most of the villages and towns of the province, calling mass meetings and organizing Communist cadres among the youth. Their losses were negligible, but they still faced the problem of crossing the Yangtze. By his swift concentration on the Kweichow-Szechuan border, Chiang Kai-shek had skillfully blocked the short, direct roads that led to the great river. He now placed his main hope of exterminating the Reds on the prevention of this crossing at any point, hoping to push them far to the southwest, or into the wastelands of Tibet. To his various commanders and the provincial warlords he telegraphed: ""The fate of the nation and the party depends on bottling up the Reds south of the Yangtze.""

Suddenly, early in May, 1935, the Reds turned southward and entered Yunnan, where China's frontier meets Burma and Indochina. A spectacular march in four days brought them within ten miles of the capital, Yunnanfu, and warlord Lung Yun (Dragon Cloud) frantically mobilized all available troops for defense. Chiang's reinforcements meanwhile moved in from Kweichow in hot pursuit. Chiang himself and Mme. Chiang, who had been staying in Yunnanfu, hastily repaired down the French railway toward Indochina. A big squadron of Nanking bombers kept up their daily egg-laying over the Reds, but on they came. Presently the panic ended. It was discovered that their drive on Yunnanfu had been only a diversion carried out by a few troops. The main Red forces were moving westward, obviously with the intention of crossing the river at Lengkai, one of the few navigable points of the Upper Yangtze.

Through the wild mountainous country of Yunnan, the Yangtze River flows deeply and swiftly between immense gorges, great peaks in places rising in defiles of a mile or more, with steep walls of rock lifting almost perpendicularly on either side. The few crossings had all been occupied long ago by government troops. Chiang was well pleased. He now ordered all boats drawn to the north bank of the river and burned. Then he started his own troops, and Lung Yun's, in an enveloping movement around the Red Army, hoping to finish it off forever on the banks of this historic and treacherous stream.

Seemingly unaware of their fate, the Reds continued to march rapidly westward in three columns toward Lengkai. The boats had been burned there, and Nanking pilots reported that a Red vanguard had begun building a bamboo bridge. Chiang became more confident; this bridge-building would take weeks. But one evening, quite unobtrusively, a Red battalion suddenly reversed its direction. On a phenomenal forced march it covered eighty-five miles in one night and day, and in late afternoon descended upon the only other possible ferry crossing in the vicinity, at Chou P'ing Fort. Dressed in captured Nanking uniforms, the battalion entered the town at dusk without arousing comment, and quietly disarmed the garrison.

Boats had been withdrawn to the north bank — but they had not been destroyed. (Why spoil boats, when the Reds were hundreds of li distant, and not coming there anyway? So the government troops may have reasoned.) But how to get one over to the south bank? After dark the Reds escorted a village official to the river and forced him to call out to the guards on the opposite side that some government troops had arrived and wanted a boat. Unsuspectingly one was sent across. Into it piled a detachment of these ""Nanking"" soldiers, who soon disembarked on the north shore — in Szechuan at last. Calmly entering the garrison, they surprised guards who were peacefully playing mah-jong and whose stacked weapons the Reds took over without any struggle.

Meanwhile the main forces of the Red Army had executed a wide countermarch, and by noon of the next day the vanguard reached the fort. Crossing was now a simple matter. Six big boats worked constantly for nine days. The entire army was transported into Szechuan without a life lost. Having concluded the operation, the Reds promptly destroyed the vessels and lay down to sleep. When Chiang's forces reached the river, two days later, the rear guard of their enemy called cheerily to them from the north bank to come on over, the swimming was fine. The government troops were obliged to make a detour of over 200 li to the nearest crossing, and the Reds thus shook them from their trail. Infuriated, the Generalissimo now flew to Szechuan, where he mobilized new forces in the path of the oncoming horde, hoping to cut them off at one more strategic river — the great Tatu.

The Heroes of Tatu
The crossing of the Tatu River was the most critical single incident of the Long March. Had the Red Army failed there, quite possibly it would have been exterminated. The historic precedent for such a fate already existed. On the banks of the remote Tatu the heroes of the Three Kingdoms and many warriors since then had met defeat, and in these same gorges the last of the T'ai-p'ing rebels, an army of 100,000 led by Prince Shih Ta-k'ai, was in the nineteenth century surrounded and completely destroyed by the Manchu forces under the famous Tseng Kuo-fan. To warlords Liu Hsiang and Liu Wen-hui, his allies in Szechuan, and to his own generals in command of the government pursuit, Generalissimo Chiang now wired an exhortation to repeat the history of the T'ai-p'ing.

But the Reds also knew about Shih Ta-k'ai, and that the main cause of his defeat had been a costly delay. Arriving at the banks of the Tatu, Prince Shih had paused for three days to honor the birth of his son — an imperial prince. Those days of rest had given his enemy the chance to concentrate against him, and to make the swift marches in his rear that blocked his line of retreat. Realizing his mistake too late, Prince Shih had tried to break the enemy encirclement, but it was impossible to maneuver in the narrow terrain of the defiles, and he was erased from the map.

The Reds determined not to repeat his error. Moving rapidly northward from the Gold Sand River (as the Yangtze there is known) into Szechuan, they soon entered the tribal country of warlike aborigines, the ""White"" and ""Black"" Lolos of Independent Lololand. Never conquered, never absorbed by the Chinese who dwelt all around them, the turbulent Lolos had for centuries occupied that densely forested and mountainous spur of Szechuan whose borders are marked by the great southward arc described by the Yangtze just east of Tibet. Chiang Kai-shek could well have confidently counted on a long delay and weakening of the Reds here which would enable him to concentrate north of the Tatu. The Lolos' hatred of the Chinese was traditional, and rarely had any Chinese army crossed their borders without heavy losses or extermination.

But the Reds had already safely passed through the tribal districts of the Miao and the Shan peoples, aborigines of Kweichow and Yunnan, and had won their friendship and even enlisted some tribesmen in their army. Now they sent envoys ahead to parley with the Lolos. On the way they captured several towns on the borders of independent Lololand, where they found a number of Lolo chieftains who had been imprisoned as hostages by provincial Chinese warlords. Freed and sent back to their people, these men naturally praised the Reds.

In the vanguard of the Red Army was Commander Liu Po-ch'eng, [2] who had once been an officer in a warlord army of Szechuan. Liu knew the tribal people, and their inner feuds and discontent. Especially he knew their hatred of Chinese, and he could speak something of the Lolo tongue. Assigned the task of negotiating a friendly alliance, he entered their territory and went into conference with the chieftains. The Lolos, he said, opposed warlords Liu Hsiang and Liu Wen-hui and the Kuomintang; so did the Reds. The Lolos wanted to preserve their independence; Red policies favored autonomy for all the national minorities of China. The Lolos hated the Chinese because they had been oppressed by them; but there were ""White"" Chinese and ""Red"" Chinese, just as there were ""White"" Lolos and ""Black"" Lolos, and it was the White Chinese who had always slain and oppressed the Lolos. Should not the Red Chinese and the Black Lolos unite against their common enemies, the White Chinese? The Lolos listened interestedly. Slyly they asked for arms and bullets to guard their independence and help Red Chinese fight the Whites. To their astonishment, the Reds gave them both.

And so it happened that not only a speedy but a politically useful passage was accomplished. Hundreds of Lolos enlisted with the ""Red"" Chinese to march to the Tatu River to fight the common enemy. Some of those Lolos were to trek clear to the Northwest. Liu Po-ch'eng drank the blood of a newly killed chicken before the high chieftain of the Lolos, who drank also, and they swore blood brotherhood in the tribal manner. By this vow the Reds declared that whosoever should violate the terms of their alliance would be even as weak and cowardly as the fowl.
Thus a vanguard division of the First Army Corps, led by Lin Piao, reached the Tatu Ho. On the last day of the march they emerged from the forests of Lololand (in the thick foliage of which Nanking pilots had completely lost track of them), to descend suddenly on the river town of An Jen Ch'ang, just as unheralded as they had come into Chou P'ing Fort. Guided over narrow mountain trails by the Lolos, the vanguard crept quietly up to the little town and from the heights looked down to the river bank, and saw with amazement and delight one of the three ferryboats made fast on the south bank of the river! Once more an act of fate had befriended them.

How had it happened? On the opposite shore there was only one regiment of the troops of General Liu Wen-hui, the co-dictator of Szechuan province. Other Szechuan troops, as well as reinforcements from Nanking, were leisurely proceeding toward the Tatu, but the single regiment meanwhile must have seemed enough. A squad should have been ample, with all boats moored to the north. But the commander of that regiment was a native of the district; he knew the country the Reds must pass through, and how long it would take them to penetrate to the river. They would be many days yet, he could have told his men. And his wife, one learned, had been a native of An Jen Ch'ang, so he must cross to the south bank to visit his relatives and his friends and to feast with them. Thus it happened that the Reds, taking the town by surprise, captured the commander, his boat, and their passage to the north.

Sixteen men from each of five companies volunteered to cross in the first boat and bring back the others, while on the south bank the Reds set up machine guns on the mountainsides and over the river spread a screen of protective fire concentrated on the enemy's exposed positions. It was May. Floods poured down the mountains, and the river was swift and even wider than the Yangtze. Starting far upstream, the ferry took two hours to cross and land just opposite the town. From the south bank the villagers of An Jen Ch'ang watched breathlessly. They would be wiped out! But wait. They saw the voyagers land almost beneath the guns of the enemy. Now, surely, they would be finished. And yet . . . from the south bank the Red machine guns barked on. The onlookers saw the little party climb ashore, hurriedly take cover, then slowly work their way up a steep cliff overhanging the enemy's positions. There they set up their own light machine guns and sent a downpour of lead and hand grenades into the enemy redoubts along the river.

Suddenly the White troops ceased firing, broke from their redoubts, and fled to a second and then a third line of defense. A great murmur went up from the south bank and shouts of ""Hao!"" drifted across the river to the little band who had captured the ferry landing. Meanwhile the first boat returned, towing two others, and on the second trip each carried eighty men. The enemy had fled. That day and night, and the next, and the next, those three ferries of An Jen Ch'ang worked back and forth until at last nearly a division had been transferred to the northern bank, but the river flowed faster and faster. The crossing became more and more difficult. On the third day it took four hours to shift a boatload of men from shore to shore. At this rate it would be weeks before the whole army and its animals and supplies could be moved. Long before the operation was completed they would be encircled. The First Army Corps had now crowded into An Jen Ch'ang, and behind were the flanking columns, and the transport and rear guard. Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes had found the spot, and heavily bombed it. Enemy troops were racing up from the southeast; others approached from the north. A hurried military conference was summoned by Lin Piao. Chu Teh, Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, and P'eng Teh-huai had by now reached the river. They took a decision and began to carry it out at once.
Some 400 li to the west of An Jen Ch'ang, where the gorges rise very high and the river flows narrow, deep, and swift, there was an iron-chain suspension bridge called the Liu Ting Chiao — the Bridge Fixed by Liu. [3] It was the last possible crossing of the Tatu east of Tibet. Toward this the barefoot Reds now set out along a trail that wound through the gorges, at times climbing several thousand feet, again dropping low to the level of the swollen stream itself and wallowing through waist-deep mud. If they captured the Liu Ting Chiao the whole army could enter central Szechuan. If they failed they would have to retrace their steps through Lololand, re-enter Yunnan, and fight their way westward toward Likiang on the Tibetan border — a detour of more than a thousand li, which few might hope to survive.

As their main forces pushed westward along the southern bank, the Red division already on the northern bank moved also. Sometimes the gorges between them closed so narrowly that the two lines of Reds could shout to each other across the stream; sometimes that gulf between them measured their fear that the Tatu might separate them forever, and they stepped more swiftly. As they wound in long dragon Ales along the cliffs at night their 10,000 torches sent arrows of light slanting down the dark face of the imprisoning river. Day and night these vanguards moved at double-quick, pausing only for brief ten-minute rests and meals, when the soldiers listened to lectures by their weary political workers, who over and over again explained the importance of this one action, exhorting each to give his last breath, his last urgent strength, for victory in the test ahead of them. There could be no slackening of pace, no halfheartedness, no fatigue. ""Victory was life,"" said P'eng Teh-huai; ""defeat was certain death.""

On the second day the vanguard on the right bank fell behind. Szechuan troops had set up positions in the road, and skirmishes took place. Those on the southern bank pressed on more grimly. Presently new troops appeared on the opposite bank, and through their field glasses the Reds saw that they were White reinforcements, hurrying to the Bridge Fixed by Liu. For a whole day these troops raced each other along the stream, but gradually the Red vanguard, the pick of all the Red Army, pulled away from the enemy's tired soldiers, whose rests were longer and more frequent, whose energy seemed more spent, and who were perhaps none too anxious to die for a bridge.

The Bridge Fixed by Liu was built centuries ago, and in the manner of all bridges of the deep rivers of western China. Sixteen heavy iron chains, with a span of some 100 yards or more, were stretched across the river, their ends imbedded on each side under great piles of cemented rock, beneath the stone bridgeheads. Thick boards lashed over the chains made the road of the bridge, but upon their arrival the Reds found that half this wooden flooring had been removed, and before them only the bare iron chains swung to a point midway in the stream. At the northern bridgehead an enemy machine-gun nest faced them, and behind it were positions held by a regiment of White troops. The bridge should, of course, have been destroyed, but the Szechuanese were sentimental about their few bridges; it was not easy to rebuild them, and they were costly. Of Liu Ting it was said that ""the wealth of the eighteen provinces contributed to build it."" And who would have thought the Reds would insanely try to cross on the chains alone? But that was what they did.

No time was to be lost. The bridge must be captured before enemy reinforcements arrived. Once more volunteers were called for. One by one Red soldiers stepped forward to risk their lives, and, of those who offered themselves, thirty were chosen. Hand grenades and Mausers were strapped to their backs, and soon they were swinging out above the boiling river, moving hand over hand, clinging to the iron chains. Red machine guns barked at enemy redoubts and spattered the bridgehead with bullets. The enemy replied with machine-gunning of his own, and snipers shot at the Reds tossing high above the water, working slowly toward them. The first warrior was hit, and dropped into the current below; a second fell, and then a third. But as others drew nearer the center, the bridge flooring somewhat protected these dare-to-dies, and most of the enemy bullets glanced off, or ended in the cliffs on the opposite bank.

Probably never before had the Szechuanese seen fighters like these — men for whom soldiering was not just a rice bowl, and youths ready to commit suicide to win. Were they human beings or madmen or gods? Was their own morale affected? Did they perhaps not shoot to kill? Did some of them secretly pray that these men would succeed in their attempt? At last one Red crawled up over the bridge flooring, uncapped a grenade, and tossed it with perfect aim into the enemy redoubt. Nationalist officers ordered the rest of the planking torn up. It was already too late. More Reds were crawling into sight. Paraffin was thrown on the planking, and it began to bum. By then about twenty Reds were moving forward on their hands and knees, tossing grenade after grenade into the enemy machine-gun nest.

Suddenly, on the southern shore, their comrades began to shout with joy. ""Long live the Red Army! Long live the Revolution! Long live the heroes of Tatu Ho!"" For the enemy was withdrawing in pell-mell flight. Running full speed over the remaining planks of the bridge, through the flames licking toward them, the assailants nimbly hopped into the enemy's redoubt and turned the abandoned machine gun against the shore.
More Reds now swarmed over the chains, and arrived to help put out the fire and replace the boards. And soon afterwards the Red division that had crossed at An Jen Ch'ang came into sight, opening a flank attack on the remaining enemy positions, so that in a little while the White troops were wholly in flight — either in flight, that is, or with the Reds, for about a hundred Szechuan soldiers here threw down their rifles and turned to join their pursuers. In an hour or two the whole army was joyously tramping and singing its way across the River Tatu into Szechuan. Far overhead angrily and impotently roared the planes of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Reds cried out in delirious challenge to them.

For their distinguished bravery the heroes of An fen Ch'ang and Liu Ting Chiao were awarded the Gold Star, highest decoration in the Red Army of China.

I am trying to make a client-server application using some person's code for console as an example. In the Main function he uses this for receiving packets. He sends a packet from one client and receives it with this on another. ReceivePacket is a custom function that does some things when a packet is received. I am using WinForms and I need to catch all sent packets somehow. What if I put this line in the constructor of my main form? Will it work then? Or should I place it somewhere else? My app is not finished yet so I can't just launch and check.,1,0.75

"I was using Amazon Cognito user pool for login.When i access my web application i will redirect to Once logged in with the username/password of a user from the pool, I will be redirected to the callback URL with the code as a query parameter. I can use this to get tokens. How do I integrate this in postman so that I can use the token for my upcoming request",1,0.75
"I'm building a site with Nuxt/Vue, and it's using a GraphQL backend API. We access this using the Apollo module for Nuxt. In a page component, you can do this (I think this is called a Smart Query, but I'm not sure): But you can also do the query like this I think, using the Nuxt asyncData hook: I'm not sure what the difference is between these two ways, and which is better. Does anyone know? I couldn't find an explanation in the docs anywhere.",1,0.75
"I am configuring an app with various frontends (mobile and web apps) and a single API backend, powered by Lambda and accessed via AWS API Gateway. As I'm planning to use Cognito to authenticate and authorize users, I have set up a Cognito User Pool authorizer on my API Gateway and several API methods. With an architecture like this, it seems logical that my apps (e.g. an iOS or Vue.js app) are the Client applications from an OAuth perspective, and my API Gateway backend is a Resource Server. Based on this Auth0 forum post it seems clear that I should therefore use an ID token in my client app, and pass an Access Token to authorize my API Gateway resources. When I hit the Cognito /oauth2/authorize endpoint to get an access code and use that code to hit the /oauth2/token endpoint, I get 3 tokens - an Access Token, an ID Token and a Refresh Token. So far so good, as I should have what I need. This is where I've run into difficulties - using the test function on the API Gateway Cognito User Pool Authorizer console, I can paste in the ID token and it passes (decoding the token on-screen). But when I paste in the Access Token, I get 401 - unauthorized . In my Cognito setup, I have enabled Authorization Code Grant flow only, with email and openid scopes (this seems to be the minimum allowed by Cognito as I get an error trying to save without at least these ticked). Do I need to add some specific scopes to get API Gateway to authorize a request with the Access Code? If so, where are these configured? Or am I missing something? Will API Gateway only allow an ID token to be used with a Cognito User Pool Authorizer?",1,0.75
"So I made my own API using nodejs, express and mongoDB. I made the routes and tested them with postman and they all work. Now I want to use these routes on my react app but I can't seem to figure out how. I already did something similar with a public API in the app which works but now with using my own API I can't seem to find a proper way to CRUD the data on the page. All help is appreciated ! Here is a link to the Github repository so you can take a look at the code. To clarify it is about showing/making a list not about showing the weather because that already works. https://github.com/VColson/weatherapp Please ask if there are any things I need to clarify some more. Thank you !",1,0.75
"The problem itself isn't that hard to find a solution but when i get to code it well... Here the code: #include #include int n; using namespace std; int input(); int num_count(); void new_val(); int main() { n=input(); new_val(); } int input() { int x; cout<<""Insert:""; cin>>x; return x; } int num_count() { int sub_n=n; int amount=0; while(sub_n>0) { sub_n=sub_n/10; amount++; } return amount; } void new_val() { int m[100]={}; int i; int count_n=num_count()-1; for(i=0;n>0;i++) { m[i]=n/(int)(pow(10,count_n)); switch(m[i]) { case 0:cout<""Zero"";break; case 1:cout<<""One""; break; case 2:cout<<""Two""; break; case 3:cout<<""Three"";break; case 4:cout<<""Four"";break; case 5:cout<<""Five"";break; case 6:cout<<""Six"";break; case 7:cout<<""Seven"";break; case 8:cout<<""Eight"";break; case 9:cout<<""Nine"";break; } n=n%(int)pow(10,count_n); count_n--; } } The problem I found is very confusing,when i ran the program with 123(i have used debugging to check the value multiple time)it run smoothly with the two first number but on the last numbers it always get weird result Ex: 123 gives One Two Four 7895 gives Seven Nine Four(this is the weirdest) I can assume that there is some thing wrong with the new_val() function specifically this line: **n=n%(int)pow(10,count_n);** When I the debugging watches it was after this line that n's value get messed up but when i paste it into the main() function it worked just fine.I hope this is not a stupid mistake of mine but if it is,can you please tell me the problem and why did an idiot like me got it?",1,0.75
"I've been scratching my head for about 2 days on how to solve what seemed to be a simple task, but it's starting to drive me crazy. I have an application where users will use SAML 2.0 to authenticate. I have a react-application set up for the front-end, and was thinking I was gonna use JWT to secure the rest-api communication between front-end and backend. When a user signs in, the flow is the following: User accesses www.server.com/ and gets served the static HTML with react-application User clicks 'Sign in' and accesses www.server.com/login passport-saml redirects user to saml identity provider. User logs in. User calls back to www.server.com/callback with a SamlResponse in the req.body which is decoded by passport-saml and put into req.user. If the user doesn't already exist, I create the user in the database. I create a JWT. What should I do next? The problem is that the user is not in the react-application when calling back from the identity provider, so I've lost all state in the application, so whatever I reply with will get sent to the browser. Is there any way I could force the browser to give me the SamlResponse which the identityprovider is calling back with? Then I could send it to the server as a http-request from the react-application.",1,0.75
