# distributed-csv-labeler
# Distributed BERT Labeler

A distributed, fault-tolerant pipeline for labeling large datasets to train a BERT classifier.  
Built with **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **peer-to-peer shard replication**, this system can scale across multiple machines on a local network and automatically recover from node crashes.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Distributed Processing**: Multiple identical nodes (no separate server/client image).  
- **Leader Election**: Nodes elect a leader based on the most regressed index.  
- **Task Distribution**: Leader hands out contiguous CSV ranges for labeling.  
- **Shard Replication**: Each node writes append-only JSONL shards and pulls completed shards from peers.  
- **Fault Tolerance**: If the leader crashes, another node promotes itself and resumes without data loss.  
- **Final Merge**: All shards are deduplicated (by a stable SHA1 ID) into one gold CSV.  
- **Dockerized**: Build once, run anywhere (Linux, Windows, macOS).
