  "To give a little context to my issue... I have a Java EE web application (as a UI / client) that accesses services for data / business logic via a REST interface using the JAX-RS 2.0 client API (Resteasy implementation). Currently I inject a new JAXRS Client instance per request using a RequestScoped CDI managed bean, the thinking being that the client app may call multiple backend resources per request and I reuse the same JAXRS Client for the whole request (although I read somewhere this may not be correct as I am potentially changing the URI for each invocation) The documentation for JAXRS Client seems to suggest that the client is a potentially expensive operation and the app should limit the amount of connections it creates. It also seems to contradict itself and suggest the client should be closed once all the requests to a particular WebTarget are finished. The client application could potentially support thousands of simultaneous users so creating and destroying thousands of 'expensive clients' does not seem to be the correct approach so am thinking a shared client pool is more appropriate but there doesn't seem to be any information on how this should be achieved. All examples appear to show creating a new client for the request and a) closing it after or b) not closing it but not really explaining what happens on a second request. Can you help provide some answers on how you think this would be solved or information on what the best practice for this approach is. Thanks.": {

I was already planning on using a BERT model to run the search classification because it'll get the semantic understanding of the user input. There are considerations to be made relative to input length. We could say whether if it's over maybe say 600 characters and then there's no purpose in trying to do heuristics. And we can just jump straight to BERT classification. The only problem with that is if there is input context given like for example please summarize this for me and it's a whole essay so we need to segment for that. As for BERT classification we can use that. We were already going to use that for search classification. We could use the heuristics and NLP to pull out entities. As for the actual questions that might be a little harder so the best way to do that might just be to have a very short cut off of maybe about 15 characters. I'm just thinking aloud when I'm doing this because I'm dictating but I don't really see how we could reliably and consistently pull out a coherent response using heuristics but maybe there's something that I'm missing here.": {

  "I'm happy where we're getting with this. I think we need to go over on how to use dependency parsing for our Heuristics approach, because if we're already going to be running named entity recognition, then we might as well run some language processing if the model's already loaded into memory, because it should be under a second of processing time, especially if it's under 15 characters, and if we can get our dependency parsing tags, then we can reassemble. If it's under 15 characters, then there should be minimal variability, and correct me here if I'm wrong, because I may be, minimal variability in sentence structures, so we might just be able to reconstruct sentences based on their dependency tags relative to each other, so that we can pull out our, at least our subject and our main action, and if our main action is within a given database of what, or find, or do, then we can pull out a question there and pass it into our BERT classifier, but then, and I'm dictating again, so again, correct me if I'm wrong, but in saying this out loud, I don't see how this entirely helps us with our final goal of just classifying a search action, whereas just running this through a BERT classifier by itself just allows us to get our search classification right away without having to do anything, because if we're already going to be running named entity recognition, and if we already have an index database with given entities, if we can just cross-reference our named entities to that database, and then just have BERT run some semantic understanding of the question, and then use our entities to check for relevance in our database, I don't see any place for heuristics here, because we don't need the question fully if we're already running this via, or by an LLM. The only place where I can see needing a fully reconstructed question in text would be to optimize for BERT classification, but with the challenges and the semantics lost of reconstructing a question using heuristics, I don't think the advantages are there, unless it's a very specific case, and being able to determine that case is difficult. It would have to be extraordinarily simple questions, like what is the time right now, or what is the weather in this area, and these just aren't questions people usually ask LLMs. If we're staying with our target audience here of keeping this as an on-device, lightweight, high-storage way of running a natural language model for, let's say, offline applications, or even low-power applications, where we're less concerned with our storage and memory costs, or we are worried about RAM, but less storage, and we're more worried about power and CPU runtime, then, again, I don't see heuristics, but please correct me if I'm wrong, because I know we have a whole data outline for heuristics and how we're going to run them.": {

  "Well, let's revisit our project parameters, right? So, I think what I'm going for here personally is that the main computational load for this project will be the natural language model. And because of how heavy of a computational load here is, I would like most of the optimization just to be running a smaller large language model for actual search queries. So, I want all my pre-processing and all of that to be done relatively quickly, so that if we were to port to a smaller device, all we would have to do is run a smaller quantized model. And we don't have to rework our search input pipeline, and that way we don't have to deal with latency between asking questions. And that allows us more headroom, firstly, for running a larger model and for just parsing more data. And secondly, that allows a lot more flexibility in migrating to lower power devices. I don't see a use for heuristics here, to be completely honest. I think originally when I was doing this project, I thought that there might just be a clever way of reconstructing full questions using dependency parsing. But it seems a little unreasonable, especially with all the variation with how questions are submitted. Please let me know if there's any use case for dependency parsing here, I really can't see one. For really short or fragmented queries, let's start at the beginning. It's really hard to figure out what exactly we should do, because, and I think we need to get back to starting at the beginning to our ending. If a user were to type the word hello, obviously, we can understand just based on common sense that that doesn't require a search, it should just be passed directly onto an LLM. But we still have to go through all the motions of our pre-processing. So that's where it gets tough. But if a user just submits a simple query, but with a lot of characters, like, can you please summarize this for me, and then it's a 650 word essay, that's going to require a lot of pre-processing. But then how are we going to know what to process and what not to process? And that's where the issues of natural language come in, where that, again, is just something that we would pass on to a large language model. And what we could do, perhaps, is self-prompting via the large language model. So if a given input query is larger than a certain amount, we can just have the large language model handle that entirely and give us all the information that we need. And if it's smaller than a certain amount, we can use BERT classification and our named entity recognition to pull out search terms. The problem with this is, and now I'm wondering if we could just use named entity recognition for the beginning, and I'm thinking specifically about essays and whatnot. Again, just think about this for a second and just give me all possibilities, because I don't know, I don't have an entirely optimized idea of what we should be doing here.": {

  "We should also consider chat history as well as, or sorry, not as well as, but accounting for, for example, let's say the user asks a question about the Han dynasty and then the LLM responds talking about the Great Wall of China or the, or a given war within the dynasty, and then the user asks, oh, can you give me more information about that? In isolation, the term, can you give me more information about that, doesn't mean anything, nor does it prompt a search because there's no entity directly named within it, but based on chat and, based on chat history, we know that that is referencing the Han dynasty or a specific attribute that was mentioned about the Han dynasty. So from there, there's a lot to be considered in terms of context and in terms of processing, and I think it's, it's a little difficult right now because we're trying to handle input processing in isolation where it really is the crux of the entire project. It's, it's kind of like trying to build a foundation without accounting for the weight of the house. So it may make sense to go back to the drawing board in some contexts relative to input processing, although I did account for this slightly, but I didn't necessarily account for processing. So what do you, what do you write, what do you reckon would be the best way to handle both chat history as well as input types? Because it seems like we might, we may need a generalized solution. What I'm thinking is that we could perhaps store chat history attributes within the text file as opposed to overall model context because we have tokenized model context as part of the Llama CCP API, I do believe. So perhaps we could parse, we could pass in relevant information into the model. I don't know. What do you think?": {

    "confidence": 0.78,
    "reasoning": "context and state management discussion"
  },
  "Okay, so based on everything that we've described, what should we define as the constraints for our project? Because we can't really have our cake and eat it. If we want model history to be preserved and for proper processing, we cannot skip out on context, but we really can't preserve too much context. Now, there are ways we can get around this just by storing preprocessed context. And perhaps linking entities to relevant sources. So that we could use something a little more advanced and say that, oh, this question was relevant to this entity. And if this entity appears again in a question manner, such as a dependency parsing, we could search again. But that just seems difficult and easy to get incorrect, given the wrong context. So I think we should stick to preserving context. And then based on character input. So for the user input, we can use a BERT classifier, as well as the named entities for the previous input. And assign a relevance score for heuristics wise. And further, we can go back to our original point of LLM self prompting for long inputs, including context. And we can also include a separate bar within the UI to input reference material. And that way, we don't really have to necessarily deal too much. Or we don't have to objectively deal with the input preprocessing, because we are making the implicit assumption that people will add reference materials externally. And we can just pass those into the LLM directly. So I think right now, we're kind of going to have to take a multi-pronged approach, where depending on the user input, we'll skip out on heuristics entirely for preprocessing, at the very least. And we'll skip on heuristics for question reconstruction, but we can normalize and lemanize, lemanticize, or you know what I mean, user context, user input. And we can pass that into BERT. And then based on the context, based on the input length, and our named entities recognized, if it's less than a certain amount, then we can just rely on BERT semantic understanding, pull out search terms, as well as pulling out whether we should search or not. Otherwise, what we could do is if it's over a certain amount, we can just pass it directly into the LLM. And that should be a relatively foolproof method of not having to worry about whether we're catching everything or not, or if we're processing too much, because then we can just make the assumption that, oh, if it's over this amount of characters, then BERT just won't be able to handle it properly. So we can pass it onto our LLM. We can request that the LLM that we already have loaded, or preferably, we can use a smaller LLM. The only problem with that is that we have to deload our larger LLM from memory and load our smaller LLM. So any time savings might just be negated by that. Regardless, we would ask some sort of LLM, what we should do with the given input. And then we can just use the same parameters as BERT. We can request a search classification, whether it should be searched or not. Then we can get search terms based on our database. We could use a fine-tuned, pre-trained LLM based on our data for that. But again, then we run into memory loading problems, because it takes a significant amount of time to load these things into memory, especially if we're going to be running on lower-powered devices that tend to have lower memory bandwidth. So that's it for this video. I hope you found it helpful. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

  "I think a big part of the problem that I'm personally facing right now is that I spend a lot of time just talking, and not a lot of time coding, and not a lot of time, you know, really playing with these concepts and getting to understand their limitations and their strengths. So at this point I'm getting, and a lot of that has just been being drowned by the heuristics and the dependency parsing, trying to make that work, and trying to make an imperfect solution be perfect. So I think even if there is a possibility that it could work, the time that it would take to make that work perfectly, or at least good enough to be usable, is just unnecessary and it's almost just impractical. So BERT should be good, and then we can use our hard-coded context length based on our specific model, and then I'm thinking of maybe ways to fine-tune it using a larger LLM just once, to just go back and forth and get some questions, and I'll deal with that separately. And then we can use search classification, and then we can get started on the LlamaCCP user-facing model, and I believe that just using the user-facing model, because it should already have access to all of the context, we could just use that directly. Although now that I'm thinking about it, we may have to use a separate instance of the model, because we don't want to dilute the user chat with our self-prompting of search terms in the database index. So here's what I'm thinking, right? Let's scrap the dependency parsing as we already decided to do. Let's run with the fine-tuned BERT classifier for the less than 650 character input lengths. Let's continue on with our section within the UI for reference material, and then let's simplify down this project a little bit so that we don't have to worry about development overhead. And what I would like you to do right now is to compile everything from project files as well as previous chats, and specifically this one, about everything relating to our BERT classifier and our user-facing large language model, and I would like you to put it all together in possible approaches, and just explore all of the other things on how we should really go about prototyping this all out, and then I'd like you to list it down for me, and then so I can start doing research, and then just get everything down, read it, and just start coding quick and dirty, and then optimize later on.": {

  "So based on that, as well as the BERT classifier, I think we should go ahead with putting together just a detailed report to get everything down on paper and to get everything all in one place and then get to coding. So let's start at the top, work to the bottom with our approach. So starting with the user context, just the beginning, we're given user context. Now, this needs preprocessing regardless for a BERT classifier. So could you give me the best methods of classifying, of processing user data for BERT classifications, especially for our usage? Now, ideally, we could use our preprocessed user input and our BERT classification to help in LLM prompting, but that's not necessary. Specifically, we want to preprocess data to make it more effective for our BERT classifier to determine whether there should be a search or not. Now, we have spaCy and LP, and we have named entity recognition. So judging based off those, what tools should we implement to preprocess for our BERT classifier? Remember, under 650 characters. Secondly, I want you to look into best ways to fine-tune the BERT classifier. Well, you know what? Actually, scratch that. Let's just do quick and dirty, and then we can optimize later. So if it's over 650 characters, I would like you to look into the LLM CCP Python bindings and how to prompt with those and how to manage the memory of the model, especially context, to help our LLM prompt itself. I would also like you to look into using SQL to index Wikipedia dumps. To most effectively get the information that we need from the index. And I want you to look into our multi-pronged approach based on user inputs. So while you're putting together this report, you can think of it more as a flowchart. But look at this multi-pronged approach and how to optimize, or how just to get things working and how to make it so that we can, when self-prompting, we're not diluting user context using our large language model, because we don't want it to respond to the user's prompt, thinking that the user asked it to search something, because that's what we're doing on the backend. So maybe we use our model context for a separate model, for a separate instance of the model or some capacity. So that I want you to look into because I don't know too much about it. And then let me know if there's anything else that I'm missing right now.You should have access to the GitHub repository with all the old code trying to make the heuristics work. That might help you in some capacity. I do have some interesting things in there. Firstly, I would like to work on a test class. That's not necessarily relevant.

  "For your first question, it's okay to use the existing slang-slash-abbreviation normalizing code if you think it's adequate enough for our purposes, otherwise if it would require modification, feel free to mention it and we'll implement it. I am relying on spaCy for tokenization, lemonization, and entity recognition, but I would consider alternatives such as hugging-face tokenizers, especially if they offer more flexibility when it comes to memory management, especially if it's simple to implement. As for the second point, for the LLAMA-CCP bindings and memory handling, I would prefer to use some sort of LLAMA model, preferably LLAMA3, either 1.8 billion or 7 billion, and I would run GPU encoding, but this would likely not run on Mac, at least I'm not writing it for Mac, so probably not Metal, and most of the applications that I'm running this on probably don't have CUDA implementations, so it's fine, but CPU only is likely to be the main running point of this. For Wikipedia indexing, I have Wikipedia dumps, but I'm running off of raw XML, although I wouldn't mind exploring a wiki extractor, although the XML I believe is smaller memory-wise, so maybe we should just go off that and index using SQL, whatever you think is most efficient. For number four, it's safe to assume that routing logic will be implemented in Python. I don't know how to program in C effectively, although if it does provide significant benefit, I'll be fine.
